    # Scope modes (V2):
    # - none: deny all access for this verb/entity (hide pages + block APIs)
    # - own: only owned/created records (only applies where entities have ownership fields)
    # - location|department|division: records matching the user's org assignment(s) for that dimension (LDD-enabled entities only)
    # - all: full access (no scoping)
    #
    # These are mutually exclusive per node; the Security Groups UI renders them as dropdowns.
    # Note: Most org dimensions are admin-only system configuration and should be treated as simple none/all gates.
